  Let's think about it before we report it:
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  1. This question has never arisen before and can I try to solve it myself (Baidu, curriculum).
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  It can't be solved.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  2. The question arises whether I am running every time.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  3. How can I provide sufficient information for others to help me solve the problem?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  4. The distribution of colour maps within the qq group may be more attractive to others to help solve problems.
